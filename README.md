This vim plugin requires the [syntastic][] plugin and requires the [sbt-vim-async-integration][] be installed as a plugin to sbt.  This plugin adds a syntax checker to syntastic that allows it to read log files from sbt runs.  The SBT plugin generates the log files and also sends a notice to vim to read them.
